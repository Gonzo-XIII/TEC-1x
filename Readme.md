The Next TEC-1x ?

This is a the ramblings of a TEC-1 fan that would like to release a new TEC-1 that people could continue to use for another 30 years.

In this folder you should find a schematic.  Two major chnages have been made compared to the TEC-1D.

<b>MEMORY</b>

Memory has been upgraded to 32k of RAM. Actually 28K RAM, as the 2K ROM and the address range of 2K at $3800 for the socket is overlaid over the top of the 32K RAM chip.
But, having not actually printed the board, testing and confirming it woks perfectly, is not guarenteed.  If you wish to understand what I did and make comments on how to make it better, just create an Issue or find me on the Facebook Group.

<b>Keyboard</b>

The Keyboard is the really tricky part. I am tring to meld in together parts of the DAT board and taking inspiration from the Southern Cross Computer.
The part that I don't think I have right is I think I need to tie the IO select lines together, be it with either diodes or a gate.  Again, feel free to leave an issue to discuss.
